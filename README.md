# ToolSave

**ToolSave** is a Python terminal utility designed to help you save unique or complex commands for future use. Rather than scouring the web for commands you know you'll need again, ToolSave allows you to store them conveniently. Commands are saved in JSON format, enabling easy transfer and use across different machines.

## Features

- **Crate your own command categories:** Organise your commands in categories to find them easily the next time you need them.
- **Save Commands:** Store any command that you might need in the future.
- **Easy command reuse:** After saving a command, you wont need to remember it's structure, ToolSave will only ask you for the parts the command needs and execute it with the right sintax.
- **JSON Format:** Easily transferable and compatible with any machine.
